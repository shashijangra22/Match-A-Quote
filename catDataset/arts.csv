It can remind us of where we fit on the time line of human achievement, an ultimate value of art.","['Music', 'Time', 'Past']"
arts,"No art is any good unless you can feel how it's put together. By and large it's the eye, the hand and if it's any good, you feel the body. Most of the best stuff seems to be a complete gesture, the totality of the artist's body; you can really lean on it.","['Best', 'Good', 'Together']"

There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie.

arts,"A painter, who finds no satisfaction in mere representation, however artistic, in his longing to express his inner life, cannot but envy the ease with which music, the most non-material of the arts today, achieves this end. He naturally seeks to apply the methods of music to his own art.","['Life', 'Music', 'Today']"

arts,"I don't know if One Direction will stand the test of time. I have a niece who goes crazy for them. But the only way to judge art is to wait and see if it becomes evergreen.

Pursuing 'philosophy of the universe' through art under such circumstances has led me to what I call 'stereotypical repetition.'","['Stars', 'Sun', 'Universe']"

arts,"I decided at 40 I was wasting entire chunks of my brain and didn't want to blow my one chance on Earth. I'm glad I made that decision. Writing is largely about time, while visual art is largely about space. Sometimes, as with film, you can hybridize, but I think it's basically the space part of my brain wanting equal footing with the time part.","['Time', 'Chance', 'Brain']"
arts,"In the 1960s when the recording studio suddenly really took off as a tool, it was the kids from art school who knew how to use it, not the kids from music school.

arts,"My art is not limited to the songs I create but also to the reaction it creates. I like to sit back and look at the whole thing as if it's a tornado that I'm controlling. It's creating chaos.

arts,"In the end, nature is inexorable: it has no reason to hurry and, sooner or later, it takes what belongs to it. Unconsciously and inflexibly obedient to its own laws, it doesn't know art, just as it doesn't know freedom, just as it doesn't know goodness.","['Nature', 'Freedom', 'Reason']"
arts,"A rose is the visible result of an infinitude of complicated goings on in the bosom of the earth and in the air above, and similarly a work of art is the product of strange activities in the human mind.","['Work', 'Rose', 'Earth']"
arts,Society is like a large piece of frozen water; and skating well is the great art of social life.,"['Life', 'Great', 'Society']"

arts,"I think it's difficult to do fashion for men, because either you become very over-homosexual fashion or very boring fashion. You don't want a boy who looks 15 in a little pair of shorts with some strange art... But to see just a jacket and tie is boring.","['Men', 'Fashion', 'Difficult']"
arts,"I live making comics. Comics is an industrial art but less suffering, because comics are for young people who are more adventurous. I do that. I live off comics, and then I write books, but when you want movies, you cannot make movies without money.","['Money', 'Movies', 'Suffering']"
arts,"Now, there are so many movies, so many festivals, and so many awards going on, each judged with each other, like your work is worse than others and that's not fair. How can you tell what's best and what's worst from these awards? We're talking about art.","['Work', 'Best', 'Movies']"

arts,"We have been so successful in the past century at the art of living longer and staying alive that we have forgotten how to die. Too often we learn the hard way. As soon as the baby boomers pass pensionable age, their lesson will be harsher still.","['Age', 'Past', 'Baby']"
"arts,love","Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak.

arts,"I don't listen to punk any more, unless it's right before I play. Not that I don't like it, it's nostalgic. But, it's for kids and it should be... it's not art, it's expression.","['Listen', 'Expression', 'Punk']"
arts,"Art is nothing but the expression of our dream; the more we surrender to it the closer we get to the inner truth of things, our dream-life, the true life that scorns questions and does not see them.","['Life', 'Truth', 'Dream']"
arts,"Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy.","['Change', 'Create', 'Practical']"
arts,"My own interest in art was because of my mother. My father didn't like contemporary art, so he didn't give her large sums to spend. So, she began buying prints and drawings. During my school days, I remember sitting in on many of the early meetings.","['Mother', 'Father', 'Meetings']"
arts,"Art never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of the day: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for us that which we desire.","['Problems', 'Desire', 'Social']"

arts,I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times.,['Poverty']

arts,Surrealism: An archaic term. Formerly an art movement. No longer distinguishable from everyday life.,"['Life', 'Everyday', 'Movement']"
arts,"I came up with the term 'mindfreak' because I didn't like the word 'magician.' I felt like I wanted to coin a term that would be basically the reaction to my art. It would be a mindfreak and so that's why I came up with that. But, many people say I'm really a student of humanity and psychology.","['Humanity', 'Psychology']"
arts,"There's a snobbery at work in architecture. The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it's an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics.","['Work', 'Nature', 'Science']"
arts,The whole art of war consists of guessing at what is on the other side of the hill.,"['War', 'Hill', 'Side']"

arts,"Even though you can't expect to defeat the absurdity of the world, you must make the attempt. That's morality, that's religion, that's art, that's life.","['Life', 'Religion', 'Defeat']"
arts,"I think the key to great art and great artists is to just fully be yourself and not be scared of that, and be the extremes of your personality. Show the extremes of your personality and embrace the imperfections. Embrace the things about yourself that you might not like.","['Great', 'Artists', 'Embrace']"
arts,"All I know is movies; I went to school, but movies are my reference point for everything. I figured I'd have to P.A. or intern in the art department. Because the filmmaking process is so many people creating to make one piece of magic, so I've always wanted to be involved. With the acting, I doubted it.","['Movies', 'Acting', 'Filmmaking']"

arts,Art doesn't interest me. Only artists interest me.,"['Artists', 'Interest']"
arts,I think the art fair is very much a form of urbanism. I think something really happens to the cities when such a fair happens. The city becomes an exhibition; it's amazing.,"['Amazing', 'City', 'Fair']"

arts,"The hours I spend with you I look upon as sort of a perfumed garden, a dim twilight, and a fountain singing to it. You and you alone make me feel that I am alive. Other men it is said have seen angels, but I have seen thee and thou art enough.","[""Valentine's Day"", 'Alone', 'Men']"

arts,It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art.,"['Beauty', 'Romantic', 'Character']"

arts,"Comedy is the one absolutely self-aware art form. Actually, hip-hop's another one, I suppose. Because in your songs you're talking about how good a hip-hop artist you are. It's like a painter painting a panting of himself painting a painting.","['Good', 'Comedy', 'Painting']"
